# System Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the RustSat-ESA communication stack architecture.

## Design Principles

The architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Layered Design**: Clear separation between protocol layers
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation under failure conditions
3. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time space communications
4. **Modularity**: Components can be tested and replaced independently
5. **Safety**: Rust's type system prevents common space-critical bugs

## Layer Breakdown

### Physical Layer (SpaceCAN)

The physical layer implements the SpaceCAN protocol, which is designed specifically for space communications:

```rust
pub struct SpaceCANFrame {
    pub id: u32,                    // Frame identifier
    pub data: Vec<u8>,             // Payload data
    pub priority: FramePriority,   // Message priority
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,  // Transmission timestamp
}
```

**Key Features:**
- CRC32 error detection
- Reed-Solomon error correction
- Priority-based transmission queuing
- Power-aware channel selection
- Multi-channel redundancy

**Error Handling:**
The physical layer implements comprehensive error recovery:
- Automatic retransmission on CRC failures
- Forward error correction for noisy channels
- Channel switching on persistent errors
- Power management during low-battery conditions

### Network Layer (Mesh Networking)

The network layer provides routing and topology management for satellite constellations:

```rust
pub struct MeshNetwork {
    nodes: HashMap<u32, NetworkNode>,
    routing_table: RoutingTable,
    topology: NetworkTopology,
    ground_stations: HashSet<u32>,
}
```

**Routing Algorithm:**
The system uses a hybrid routing approach:
1. **Proactive**: Maintains routing tables for known destinations
2. **Reactive**: Discovers routes on-demand for new destinations
3. **Geographic**: Uses orbital position for routing decisions

**Topology Management:**
- Automatic neighbor discovery
- Link quality assessment
- Network partitioning detection
- Ground station handover coordination

### Security Layer

Provides end-to-end security for satellite communications:

```rust
pub struct CryptoModule {
    encryption_key: Vec<u8>,
    signing_key: Vec<u8>,
    auth_tokens: HashMap<u32, (String, DateTime<Utc>)>,
}
```

**Security Features:**
- Message encryption (currently XOR for demo, designed for AES-256)
- Digital signatures for authentication
- Token-based authorization
- Emergency communication bypass
- Key rotation mechanisms

### Application Layer (CubeSat Operations)

Handles mission-specific functionality:

```rust
pub struct CubeSatProtocol {
    satellite_id: u32,
    mission_config: MissionConfig,
    system_state: SystemState,
    telemetry_data: Vec<TelemetryData>,
}
```

**Mission Management:**
- Command and control operations
- Telemetry data collection
- System health monitoring
- Mission timeline execution
- Emergency response procedures

## Data Flow

### Outbound Message Flow

1. **Application Layer**: Creates mission data or commands
2. **Security Layer**: Encrypts and signs the message
3. **Network Layer**: Determines routing path
4. **Physical Layer**: Encodes and transmits via SpaceCAN

### Inbound Message Flow

1. **Physical Layer**: Receives and decodes SpaceCAN frame
2. **Network Layer**: Processes routing information
3. **Security Layer**: Verifies and decrypts message
4. **Application Layer**: Processes mission data

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

The system is designed for embedded environments with limited memory:

- **Zero-copy parsing**: Messages are parsed in-place when possible
- **Memory pools**: Pre-allocated buffers for predictable memory usage
- **Circular buffers**: For telemetry data and message queues
- **Lazy initialization**: Components are initialized only when needed

### Real-time Constraints

Space communications have strict timing requirements:

- **Deterministic execution**: All operations have bounded execution time
- **Priority scheduling**: Critical messages are processed first
- **Interrupt handling**: Hardware events are handled immediately
- **Watchdog timers**: System health monitoring and recovery

### Power Management

CubeSats have severe power constraints:

- **Adaptive transmission power**: Based on link quality and distance
- **Sleep modes**: Components can be powered down when not needed
- **Battery monitoring**: Automatic power reduction at low battery levels
- **Solar panel optimization**: Transmission scheduling based on power availability

## Fault Tolerance

### Error Recovery Strategies

1. **Automatic Retry**: Failed operations are retried with exponential backoff
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality
3. **Redundancy**: Critical components have backup systems
4. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health assessment

### Failure Modes

The system is designed to handle these common failure scenarios:

- **Communication Link Failures**: Automatic route recalculation
- **Node Failures**: Network topology updates and route healing
- **Power Failures**: Emergency mode operation
- **Memory Corruption**: Error detection and recovery
- **Clock Synchronization Issues**: Timestamp validation and correction

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Each component is thoroughly unit tested:
- Protocol parsing and encoding
- Routing algorithm correctness
- Cryptographic operations
- Error handling paths

### Integration Testing

End-to-end scenarios are tested:
- Multi-hop message routing
- Ground station handovers
- Emergency communication procedures
- System recovery after failures

### Performance Testing

Critical performance metrics are benchmarked:
- Message throughput
- Latency measurements
- Memory usage profiling
- Power consumption analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Machine Learning**: Adaptive routing based on historical performance
2. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of protocol correctness
3. **Hardware Acceleration**: FPGA implementation of critical functions
4. **Advanced Error Correction**: LDPC codes for improved reliability
5. **Quantum-Safe Cryptography**: Post-quantum encryption algorithms

### Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale:
- **Constellation Size**: Supports hundreds of satellites
- **Ground Station Network**: Multiple ground stations worldwide
- **Data Volume**: Efficient compression and aggregation
- **Geographic Coverage**: Global communication coverage

This architecture provides a solid foundation for reliable, high-performance CubeSat communications while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to future requirements.
