## 🔧 Core Components Explained

### 1. **SpaceCAN Protocol** (`src/protocol/spacecan.rs`)
**What it does**: Implements a space-optimized CAN-bus protocol for satellite communications.

**Why it's needed**: Traditional communication protocols aren't designed for the harsh space environment with high radiation, long delays, and power constraints.

**Key features**:
- Frame-based communication with error detection
- Reed-Solomon error correction for space radiation
- Priority-based message queuing
- Power-aware transmission modes
- Multi-channel redundancy

**Technical highlights**:
```rust
pub struct SpaceCANFrame {
    pub id: u32,                    // Unique frame identifier
    pub data: Vec<u8>,             // Payload data
    pub priority: FramePriority,   // Message priority
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,  // Transmission time
}
```

### 2. **Mesh Networking** (`src/protocol/network.rs`)
**What it does**: Provides dynamic routing for satellite constellations.

**Why it's needed**: Satellites move constantly, so static routing doesn't work. The network must adapt to changing topology.

**Key features**:
- Dynamic route discovery and maintenance
- Ground station handover protocols
- Network resilience and self-healing
- Geographic routing using orbital mechanics
- Load balancing across multiple paths

**Technical highlights**:
- Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path routing
- Reliability-based cost calculation
- Automatic topology updates

### 3. **CubeSat Operations** (`src/cubesat/mod.rs`)
**What it does**: Handles mission-specific satellite operations and control.

**Why it's needed**: CubeSats need autonomous operation capabilities and ground control interfaces.

**Key features**:
- Command and control operations
- Mission timeline management
- System health monitoring
- Telemetry data collection
- Emergency response procedures

### 4. **Security Layer** (`src/security/mod.rs`)
**What it does**: Provides encryption and authentication for satellite communications.

**Why it's needed**: Satellite communications can be intercepted, and unauthorized commands could damage expensive spacecraft.

**Key features**:
- Message encryption (XOR for demo, designed for AES-256)
- Digital signatures for authentication
- Token-based authorization
- Emergency communication bypass
- Key rotation mechanisms

### 5. **Telemetry System** (`src/telemetry/mod.rs`)
**What it does**: Collects, processes, and manages satellite sensor data.

**Why it's needed**: Mission success depends on monitoring satellite health and collecting scientific data.

**Key features**:
- Real-time data collection
- Data compression and aggregation
- Alert threshold monitoring
- Mission timeline tracking
- Health diagnostics

### 6. **Ground Station Network** (`src/ground_station/mod.rs`)
**What it does**: Manages communication with ESA ground stations worldwide.

**Why it's needed**: Satellites need to communicate with ground stations as they orbit Earth.

**Key features**:
- ESA-compatible protocols
- Automated station selection
- Pass prediction and scheduling
- Message queuing and retry
- Network availability monitoring

### 7. **Space Simulation** (`src/simulation/mod.rs`)
**What it does**: Simulates the space environment for testing and validation.

**Why it's needed**: Space testing is expensive and risky, so simulation is crucial for development.

**Key features**:
- Orbital mechanics simulation
- Space weather modeling
- Ground station visibility
- Communication link analysis
- Realistic delay modeling

### 8. **Web Dashboard** (`src/web/`)
**What it does**: Provides a real-time web interface for mission control.

**Why it's needed**: Operators need visual interfaces to monitor satellite status and control missions.

**Key features**:
- Real-time satellite tracking
- Telemetry visualization
- System status monitoring
- Alert management
- Interactive controls

### 9. **Performance Metrics** (`src/metrics/mod.rs`)
**What it does**: Monitors system performance and collects operational data.

**Why it's needed**: Production systems need monitoring to ensure reliability and performance.

**Key features**:
- Message throughput tracking
- Latency measurement
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Custom metric collection

### 10. **Configuration Management** (`src/config/mod.rs`)
**What it does**: Manages system configuration with validation and environment overrides.

**Why it's needed**: Production systems need flexible, validated configuration management.

**Key features**:
- JSON configuration files
- Environment variable overrides
- Configuration validation
- Type-safe configuration access
- Default value management
